//Environment variables are variables that are defined in the environment in which a process runs. For example, the env command in Linux prints out the environment variables that are defined in the current shell. Environment variables are useful to store system-wide values, for examples, the PATH variable stores the list of directories to search for executable programs. In Node.js, we can access these environment variables by using the process.env object. For example, the following code prints out the value of the PATH variable.
//ex: console.log(process.env.PATH), it is a string, it is a property of the process object, it is a global object, it is an object that is available everywhere in the application.
// we create configuration files for each environment, because we want to have different configurations for each environment.
